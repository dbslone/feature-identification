## Troubleshooting
- Show outline around hovered entity
    - Given limitation of time I attempted updated three.js version and related libraries.
Without going further during quick inspection I was only able to obtain a horrible green
wall around the geometry instead of an outline around the geometry. With more item I could solve this issue.

- Upgrading three.js version resulted in colors becoming muted this may be related to enabling shadows.
  Expected this would only cast shadows in the pockets  since the abient light doesn't have a position.
  So I assumed this would be equal abient occlusion lighting which appears not be the case.
